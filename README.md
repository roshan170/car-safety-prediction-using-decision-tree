# car-safety-prediction-using-decision-tree
Developed a machine learning model to predict car safety levels (Unacceptable, Acceptable, Good, Very Good) using the Car Evaluation dataset. Applied preprocessing and trained a Decision Tree Classifier, achieving accurate predictions with decision tree visualization and feature importance for explainable results.
